"""
This document denotes the structure of a universal object identifier,
which may be used to identify records and objects.
"""

1. Character Sets
  The identifier shall only be written in SIIF 22 Set A Characters,
  consisting of [A-Z0-9-._].
  
  The identifier is NOT CASE-SENSITIVE and should be printed
  in UPPERCASE letters.
  
  When printed as Code 39, the [ ] (SPACE, 38) character
  SHALL be translated as [_] (UNDERSCORE) when read.
  
  
2. Format
  2.1 General Format
    The general format of the identifier is as follows.

    <ALN> "-" <ALN> <ALN> "-" <ALN> <ALN> <ALN> < Segments ...>

    where <ALN> denotes the set [A-Z0-9._].
    
    The first segment, denotes the object type or nature,
    the second segment denotes the object category or handling authority,
    and the third segment denotes the object subcategory.
    
    Each "-" separated segment is a child of the previous segment,
    or a node of lower level.
    
    A truncated format will be denoted in [Section 2.3].
    
    An example pair of valid identifiers is shown below.
    L-EJ-ORG-ISM--S-SIIF28--001

  2.2 Segments
    2.2.1 Generic Segment
      A Generic Segment is composed of:
      
      "-" <ALN> <ALN> <ALN>
    
      For example, "-EJN".
    
      It is preferred for backwards compatability 
      with old AIT Identifiers.
    
    
    2.2.2 Extended Segment
      An Extended Segment is composed of:
      "--" < Type > "-" < Data > "-"
      or
      "--" < Segment Length L > < Generic Segments of Length L > "-"
      
      If an Extended Segment is followed by another Extended Segment,
      or is the last Segment of the object identifier,
      the ending "-" SHALL be omitted.
      
      Examples of valid extended segments are shown below.
      --S-String-
      --4-ABCD-EFGH-
      --S-String--4-ABCD-EFGH-
      --S-String--4-ABCD-EFGH
      

  2.3 Truncated Format
    For space-efficiency, especially when printing in Code 39,
    a truncated format may be used, provided that
    all rules listed below are applied at once.
      - Remove all "-" in the Starting Segment (2.1);
      - Omit the starting "-" of a Generic Segment (2.2.1);
      - Replace the starting "--" of an Extended Segment (2.2.2) with "-".
  
    Below lists a pair of complete and truncated identifiers.
