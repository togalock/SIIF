"""
This document suggests a serialization format for encoding
data structures used during data transmission.

This is a modified version of RESP - original available at
[https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/].
"""

1. Data Types encoded
The following data types, with their prefix in square brackets [], 
are listed below.

  1a - Non-binary-safe
    - [S] String
    - [I] Integer
    - [N] Numbers (Floats)
    - [B] Booleans
      - "T" for True, "F" for False, "N" for Null
  
  1b - Binary-safe
    - [U] Binary-safe String
    - [=] Base64 Encoded Binaries
    - [L] Lists (Arrays)
    - [D] Dictionaries (Maps)
    - [X] Exception (Lists)

2. Basic Format
  All strings must be encoded in UTF-8.

  2a - Non-binary-safe
    All non-binary-safe data must not contain "\n" (10) or 
    other control characters (0-31).
    
    For all non-binary-safe elements, each element is encoded as:
    < Prefix >< Data >"\n"
    
    For example, an integer with the value -1 shall be encoded as:
    I-1\n
    
    
  2b - Binary-safe
    For all binary-safe elements, each element is encoded as:
    < Prefix >< Size >"\n"
    < data >"\n"
    
    For example, a unicode string of 你好嗎 shall be encoded as:
    U9\n
    你好嗎\n
    
    and the list [1, 2] shall be encoded as:
    L2\n
    I1\n
    I2\n
    
    
    2bi - Size Parameter
      The size parameter shall be encoded as a string.
    
      The size of a [U] Binary-safe String element shall be the
      number of bytes encoded.
    
      The size of a [L] List element shall be the number of elements
      that follows.
      
      The size of a [D] Dictionary element shall be the number of
      key-value pairs that follows.
      
      The size of a [=] Base64 Encoded Binaries element shall be the
      number of characters transmitted. If transmitting in chunks,
      the chunk size shall be multiples of 4 for bit alignment.
      
      If the size is unknown, the "?" (63) can be used in place of
      the size parameter. After the data has been transmitted,
      the stream shall be terminated with ".\n".
